# OpenGL-projects
This Project includes 2 different scenes.
They were created in the C language with the help of the OpenGL library.
The [first](Project1.c) involves a cube that has a different color on each side, moves in three-dimensional space and changes size.
The [second](Project2.c) includes a scene with a house, lawn and sun. The scene repeats itself and begins as it takes place during the day, with the sun's brightness increasing at noon and decreasing at night.
