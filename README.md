# OpenGL-projects
This Project includes 2 different scenes.
They were created in the C language with the help of the OpenGL library.
* The [first](Project1.c) involves a cube with a different color on each side, moving in three-dimensional space, and changing size.
* The [second](Project2.c) includes a scene with a house, lawn, and sun. The scene repeats itself and begins as it takes place during the day, with the sun's brightness increasing at noon and decreasing at night.
